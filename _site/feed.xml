&lt;p&gt;In 2015, I took on the role of coordinator &amp;amp; compiler of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hamiltonnature.org/birding/counts/christmas-bird-count/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hamilton Christmas Bird Count (CBC)&lt;/a&gt;. Since that time I’ve been poring through the vast amounts of data accumulated over the decades. In a series of short posts, I explore how the Christmas Bird Count records can reveal some interesting facts about bird species in Hamilton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;carolina-wren-a-non-migratory-resident&quot;&gt;Carolina Wren: A Non-Migratory Resident&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/cbc-onha/carolina-wren.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:50%; padding:0.667em;padding-right:0;padding-top:0;&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe it was in the mid-2000s when I first heard a Carolina Wren. I had no idea what I was hearing – it was a very loud bird that was surprisingly elusive, and the only bird calls I knew well enough to identify a species were rural farm birds and common urban birds. It wasn’t until the rise of mobile birding apps, which had actual recordings of bird species, that I finally identified the loud little wren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I hadn’t really heard of this wren before, so where did it come from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed the Carolina Wren has been pushing its territorial boundaries north for a few decades now. It is non-migratory – which means like some common birds we see year-round (Black-capped Chickadee, Northern Cardinal) – they generally do not migrate unless they need to find a new space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All other wren species known to either breed or overwinter in Hamilton are migratory: the aptly named Winter Wren, also-aptly-named Marsh Wren, the summer-abundant House Wren, and rare and unpredicatable Sedge Wren. (The Sedge Wren is probably the best example of a migratory pattern taken to the extreme: individuals are known to breed in completely different parts of the continent year-to-year, having little-to-no breeding site fidelity.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/cbc-onha/carolina-wren-2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:50%; padding:0.667em;padding-left:0;padding-top:0;&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is also of note is that while Carolina Wrens are tiny and like to hide from view, they are not shy when it comes to singing. Like some other resident species, they can be heard singing in the winter. Black-capped Chickadee males are known to also do this, to sing loudly during the coldest days as a way of attracting a mate or reaffirming to a mate that they are strongly suited to not only enduring the winter, but thriving and singing through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard multiple Carolina Wrens singing loudly in -20°C weather in Hamilton. So there can be no doubt that when the Hamilton CBC data shows the rise in the count of Carolina Wrens, this is not due to the improved ability to find this species with the rise of digital cameras and birding apps, they do indeed call attention to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-data&quot;&gt;The Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/cbc-onha/carw.png&quot; style=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Winter Wren has been following a consistent ebb-and-flow pattern over the last 60 years, Carolina Wrens have been sporatically found in small numbers up until the late 1990s, and since then the count totals for this species have been taking off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, 2015 was the best year by far for this species, with a count of 64 individuals. The Carolina Wren quickly has surpassed the Winter Wren as the most common wren to find in Hamilton in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many more Carolina Wrens could the region be host to? Many of the individuals counted are concentrated within the Cootes-to-Escarpment area, where there is better shelter and presumably more food for these tiny birds. They are also known to visit feeders as well, which also helps sustain the populations through harsh winters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was presumed by some that the very harsh 2014-15 winter would cause a significant die-off of the population of Carolina Wrens, but the record showing in late 2015 might very well be proof that our local stock is finally hardy enough to endure the harshest of winters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while Hamilton was the most northerly range for this species, but it is still on the move northward. While non-migratory normally, as territories of pairs of birds are established some individuals are forced to move on to find territory elsewhere. One very ambitious individual was even found in Moosonee a couple years ago, though extreme migrants like that often do not establish breeding populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="birding" /><category term="Christmas Bird Count" /><category term="nature" /><category term="ornithology" /><category term="Carolina Wren" /><category term="Hamilton&amp;#44; Ontario" /><category term="bird records" /><summary type="html">How the Hamilton Christmas Bird Count data illustrates the establishment of a booming population of Carolina Wrens in Hamilton</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">eBird Histogramr</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/histogramr/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="eBird Histogramr" /><published>2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/histogramr</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/histogramr/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ebird.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cornell’s eBird&lt;/a&gt; provides some fairly nifty looking bar graphs on Hotspot locations, but while you can download the data in a raw format, that format is a fairly obscure one.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BirdBrain&lt;/strong&gt; is a simple Javascript library for interacting with avian species names and banding codes in the ABA region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now the API is quite simple, and the data is not fully optimized, so this library is quite large in size, and I do have some plans of making slimmed down versions that do not contain scientific names and make better use of more optimized JSON structures.&lt;/p&gt;

Since that time I’ve been poring through the vast amounts of data accumulated over the decades. In a series of short posts, I explore how the Christmas Bird Count records can reveal some interesting facts about bird species in Hamilton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;comparing-brown-creeper--golden-crowned-kinglet&quot;&gt;Comparing Brown Creeper &amp;amp; Golden-crowned Kinglet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/cbc-onha/golden-crowned-kinglet.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:33%; padding:0.667em;padding-left:0;&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown Creepers and Golden-crowned Kinglets are not closely related, however they are both great examples of species found only in winter in Hamilton that are a challenge to find unless you are well-prepared to find them. Rarely would a non-birder ever notice a Brown Creeper, and to a lesser extent the same applies to Golden-crowned Kinglets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both species have several factors that make them more difficult to spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/cbc-onha/brown-creeper.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:33%; padding:0.667em;padding-right:0;padding-top:0;&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown Creepers spend their time creeping up trees on the trunk and major branches, picking out hibernating insects &amp;amp; insect larvae from within bark crevices as food. They camouflage very well against the bark, enough to be unnoticable if it is either not right in front of you, or you don’t know how to look for them. They are also small, and have a song &amp;amp; call that are high pitched enough that it is not uncommon to meet older birders who can no longer hear them at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golden-crowned Kinglets on the other hand, are found flocking together, often high in the treetops of deciduous trees, or anywhere in conifers, moving very quickly in and out of the shelter of the conifer. They are tiny (the smallest winter bird), and also have high-pitched calls that can be hard for some to hear. They feed on tiny caterpillars that somehow survive the winter in a frozen state – a fact only discovered reletively recently, in the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both, the best bet for finding and counting these species is by ear. When that isn’t practical, seeking out Black-capped Chickadee flocks in forested areas might reveal a mixed-species flock that might include one or both of these species. The kinglets will tend to group close together, and creepers will be in a flock that is spread across multiple trees, where they will climb up the trunk to near the top, then fly down to the bottom of the trunk of the next tree to climb up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-data&quot;&gt;The Data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/cbc-onha/gcki-brcr.png&quot; style=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s amazing in the Hamilton CBC data is that both species are regularly counted, and more or less line up with one another – when one is up, the other is up. If one is scarce, so is the other. They are not closely related, and do sometimes flock together in mixed-species flocks, but save for one year with a record count of kinglets, they line up well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first reason I feel this chart is significant has nothing to do with the birds themselves however, it is that it demonstrates the consistent skills of the volunteer counters in the field. There are no years where these species were not found, and low years appear to be explained by very poor weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that the consistency of the chart over the decades shows that these species &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; have stable populations. To verify this, we can take a look at another chart, which takes into account the amount of effort put into counting birds as “count-per-hour”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/cbc-onha/gcki-brcr-perhour.png&quot; style=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we see is that the raw count data isn’t very misleading. There’s a couple spikes here, but otherwise it remains fairly consistent over time with perhaps a slightly below average count in the last 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="birding" /><category term="Christmas Bird Count" /><category term="nature" /><category term="ornithology" /><category term="Hamilton&amp;#44; Ontario" /><category term="bird records" /><summary type="html">How two tiny and elusive bird species can demonstrate the skill of Hamilton's Christmas Bird Count (CBC) volunteers</summary></entry></feed>
