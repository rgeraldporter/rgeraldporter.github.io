In 2015, I took on the role of coordinator & compiler of the [Hamilton Christmas Bird Count (HCBC)](http://hamiltonnature.org/birding/counts/christmas-bird-count/){:target="_blank"} for the Hamilton Naturalists' Club. Lately I've been poring through the vast amounts of data accumulated over the decades. In a series of short posts, I explore how the Christmas Bird Count records can reveal some interesting facts about bird species in Hamilton.
