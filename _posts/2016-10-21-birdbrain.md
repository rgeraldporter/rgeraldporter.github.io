## About
**BirdBrain** is a simple Javascript library for interacting with avian species names and banding codes in the ABA region. 

Right now the API is quite simple, and the data is not fully optimized, so this library is quite large in size, and I do have some plans of making slimmed down versions that do not contain scientific names and make better use of more optimized JSON structures.
