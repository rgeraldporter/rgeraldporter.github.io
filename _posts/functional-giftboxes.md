One metaphor for functional identity/container/box that I would propose is a "Giftbox". This I think works better as a metaphor, you can't look inside without unwrapping it, and can't change its contents. Once you see what the gift is, there's no changing it, all you can do is get another gift. (This even works better with .unwrap()!)
