### Background

In 2015, I took on the role of coordinator & compiler of the [Hamilton Christmas Bird Count (CBC)](http://hamiltonnature.org/birding/counts/christmas-bird-count/){:target="_blank"}. Since that time I've been poring through the vast amounts of data accumulated over the decades. In this series of posts, I explore how the Christmas Bird Count records can reveal some interesting facts about bird species in Hamilton.

## Brown Creeper vs Golden-crowned Kinglet

The Brown Creeper and Golden-crowned Kinglets are not closely related, however they are both great examples of winter-only species in Hamilton that are a challenge to find unless you are well-versed in finding them. Rarely would a non-birder ever notice a Brown Creeper, and to a lesser extent, the same applies to Golden-crowned Kinglets.

Both species have several factors that make them more difficult to find.

They camouflage very well against the bark, enough to be unnoticable if it is either not right in front of you, or you don't know how to look for them. They are also small, and have a song & call that are high pitched enough that it is not uncommon to meet older birders who can no longer hear them at all.

Golden-crowned Kinglets on the other hand, are found flocking together, often high in the treetops of deciduous trees, or anywhere in conifers, moving very quickly in and out of the shelter of the conifer. They are tiny (the smallest winter bird), and also have high-pitched calls that can be hard for some to hear.

For both, the best bet for finding and counting these species is by ear.

#### The Data

What's amazing in the Hamilton CBC data is that both species are regularly counted, and more or less line up with one another -- when one is up, the other is up. If one is scarce, so is the other. They are not related at all, and do sometimes flock together in mixed-species flocks, but save for one year with a record-count of kinglets, they line up well.

The first reason I feel this chart is significant has nothing to do with the birds themselves, however, it is that it demonstrates the consistent skills of the volunteer counters in the field. There are no years where these species were not found, and low years appear to be explained by poor weather conditions.

Beyond that the consistency of the chart over the decades shows that these species *may* have stable populations. I qualify with "may" is this chart reflect raw data that does not take into account the variable number of volunteer hours spent counting each year. 

So, for that we look at average count of each species per volunteer hour....

This chart shows that the raw count data isn't very misleading. There's a couple spikes here, but otherwise it remains fairly consistent over time with perhaps a slightly below average count in the last 15 years.
